# The awok Model of Knowledge

## Overview
awok sets out to model the logical structure of assemblages of information.  In the envisioned application, the assemblage of information being modeled is a candidate for acceptance as a web of knowledge, that is, an assemblage where the units of information are true and the connections are justified, consistent and coherent.  The goal of the envisioned application is to validate this candidacy, if deserved, or illuminate the failings, if not.

Mathematically, the awok model is a directed graph whose vertices are units of information and whose edges are logical relationships.

##Knowledge
awok's model of knowledge is compatible with the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief.  However, awok's concern is primarily with justification.  Belief is a mental state, and awok does not claim to have a mind, so awok substitutes _intensional information_ for belief, i.e., information that can form the content of a mental state.  Regarding truth, awok places on the user the burden of designating certain units of information, premises and axioms, as being true or false; awok's judgements of truth are only as valid as the user's initial designations. 

###Units of Knowledge
awok recognizes three forms of knowledge:
* a statement 
* a statement about other statements, for example if x then y
* a conjunction of statements
