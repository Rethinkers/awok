# The awok Model of Knowledge

## Overview
awok sets out to model the logical structure of assemblages of information.  In the envisioned application, the assemblage of information being modeled is a candidate for acceptance as a web of knowledge, that is, an assemblage where the units of information are true and the connections are justified, consistent and coherent.  The goal of the envisioned application is to validate this candidacy, if deserved, or illuminate the failings, if not.

Mathematically, the awok model is a directed graph whose vertices are units of information and whose edges are logical relationships.

###Caveat
The model of knowledge presented here is not meant to be "the" model of knowledge.  The purpose of the model is not to correspond to knowledge as it truly is (if such a thing exists), but to support the implementation of such a model.  In other words, it must be possible to translate the true model of knowledge into the awok model of knowledge.  If the true model is compatible with standard physics, logic and mathematics, then this translation is certain to be possible.

##Knowledge
awok's model of knowledge is compatible with the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief.  However, awok's concern is primarily with justification.  Belief is a mental state, and awok does not claim to have a mind, so awok substitutes _intentional information_ for belief, i.e., information that can form the content of a mental state (__intentional__ is the philosophical term of art for mental content that is about something).  Regarding truth, awok places on the user the burden of designating certain units of information, premises and axioms, as being true or false; awok's judgements of truth are only as valid as the user's initial designations. 

###Units of Knowledge
awok defines a __unit of knowledge__ to be any of the following:
* A __fact__: a simple statement, for example statement A that x is y, or statement B that y is probably z.
* A __rule__: a statement that relates the truth or probability of one statement to that of another statement, for example statement C that if A is true then B is true, or more simply, if A then B.
* An __understanding__: a statement which is a conjunction of statements, for example statement D that statement A and statement C, that is, that x is y and if x is y then y is probably z.
