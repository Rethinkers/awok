# The awok Model of Knowledge

## Overview
awok sets out to model the logical structure of assemblages of information.  In the envisioned application, the assemblage of information being modeled is a candidate for acceptance as a web of knowledge, that is, an assemblage where the units of information are true and the connections are justified, consistent and coherent.  The goal of the envisioned application is to validate this candidacy, if deserved, or illuminate the failings, if not.

Mathematically, the awok model is a directed graph whose vertices are units of knowledge and whose edges are logical relationships.
