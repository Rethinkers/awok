# awok
## Overview

awok is a knowledge management platform that models logical and probabilistic connections between units of knowledge.  A unit of knowledge can be a collection of documents, a single phrase, or anything in between.  The purpose of awok is to allow a user to accomplish any of the following goals:

* __delineate__ the logical structure of documents, cases, and other sets of knowledge;
* __visualize__ such logical structures;
* __validate__ such logical structures to determine if they are sound, and if not, identify the error;
* __evaluate__ such logical structures to determine the truth or probability of potential conclusions given the truth or probability of selected premises; 
* __extract__ abstract models of logical structures from sets of knowledge;
* __apply__ such abstract models to new sets of knowledge.
